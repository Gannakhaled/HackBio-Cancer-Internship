When Next Generation Sequencing came out, it drove therapeutics and medical diagnostics into the next level. This is because it allows sequencing of the whole human genome in a short period of time, allowing us to detect the number of copies of chromosomes from a single cell. This contributes to the diagnosis of patients as well as cancer research. However, a specific application of NGS plays a huge role in cancer research and diagnostics which is RNA-Seq. 


## **Why RNA Sequencing?**

RNA-Seq aims to provide insights about cancer gene expression and fusions that drive tumor progression.This is done by capturing the whole transcriptome of the patient and using a reference from a healthy tissue (_Cancer Transcriptome Analysis With RNA-Seq_, n.d.). As a result, scientists can analyze the genes that are upregulated or downregulated in the cancer patient. Moreover, RNA-Seq is able to identify gene fusions that are produced by chromosomal rearrangements such as the BCR-ABL gene. The BCR-ABL gene is identified in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients. It results from translocation of a part of chromosome 9 carrying the ABL gene and its fusion to the BCR gene on chromosome 22, forming the Philadelphia chromosome (_Definition of BCR-ABL Fusion Gene - NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms - NCI_, n.d.). As a result, RNA-Seq contributed to diagnosing CML so that physicians can start targeted therapy or chemotherapy.


## **Types of Cancer RNA-Seq methods**

There are different types of cancer RNA-Seq methods including Bulk RNA-Seq, Single cell RNA-Seq, mRNA-Seq, Total RNA Seq, and Spatial Transcriptomics(_Cancer Transcriptome Analysis With RNA-Seq_, n.d.). The most interesting method in my opinion is the single cell RNA-Seq (sc-RNASeq).This is because genetic heterogeneity of cancer cells is one of the challenges that tumor biologists face. Hence, using Bulk RNA-Seq is not preferred because it analyzes an entire tumor sample as a single entity including the gene expression of the constituent cells (Suvà & Tirosh, 2019, 7-12). Therefore, to analyze the diversity of cell types within the tumor, single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) is preferred over Bulk RNA-Seq. The scRNA-seq technology mainly involves several steps: dissociating the tissue to create a single-cell suspension, lysing the cells, converting RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) through reverse transcription, amplifying the cDNA using PCR, performing high-throughput sequencing, and analyzing the resulting data (Lili et al., 2021, 104).


## **Conclusion**

In summary, RNA-Seq has significantly advanced cancer research and diagnostics by allowing detailed and comprehensive analysis of gene expression and the identification of crucial gene fusions. Furthermore, techniques like single-cell RNA-Seq allow for a deeper understanding of tumor heterogeneity, facilitating personalized treatment protocols for patients. This progress represents a vital step toward more effective therapies in oncology.
